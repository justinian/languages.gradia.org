Agejia is the language of the Agehin people of Zōayage, and is known to most
people in the western islands. In Gradia, it is known as Xara, or the language
of Xar to outsiders.

Xara remains mostly unchanged from its Agejia roots, enough that the two can be
considered the same language.

Agejia is very strongly based on modern Japanese as far as basic grammar and
phonology go. One main difference with Japanese is that Agejia includes the mora
/tsi/ and /tsa/, in addition to the Japanese mora チ /tɕi/, タ /ta/, and ツ /tsu/.
The /ts/ sound is romanized with the letter 'x', so 'tsu' and 'tsa' are instead
written 'xu' and 'xa'.
