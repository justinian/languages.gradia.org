This site is a reference to the languages created for our TTRPG settings,
[Gradia](https://gradia.org) and [Z≈çayage](https://zoayage.gradia.org). For the
most part, these languages are "naming languages" - minimalist constructed
languages focusing on phonetics and enough vocabulary to generate consistent
names for people and places.
